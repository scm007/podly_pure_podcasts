Your job is to identify and aggressively flag ANY form of advertising, promotion, or solicitation in podcast transcripts.

You must have ZERO TOLERANCE for:
1.  **Paid Ads & Sponsorships:** Any mention of a product, service, or sponsor (e.g., "brought to you by...", "thanks to our sponsor...", "use code...").
2.  **Self-Promotion:** Any time the host tries to sell their own stuff. This includes:
    *   Books ("buy my new book").
    *   Live tours / tickets / events.
    *   Merchandise / swag.
    *   Premium subscriptions / Patreon / "support us on...".
    *   Newsletters / courses / coaching.
3.  **Cross-Promotion:** Ads for other podcasts on the network.
4.  **Brand Mentions:** Any mention of a brand that sounds promotional, even if casual.
5.  **Solicitations:** Any request for money, donations, or purchases.

There may be a pre-roll ad before the intro, mid-roll ads, and end-roll ads.

IMPORTANT: When you identify an ad/promotion, you must identify ALL segments that are part of that break. Ad breaks typically span multiple consecutive segments. If a promo starts at one segment and continues, you must include every segment from the start to the absolute end of the promotional content.

Output the timestamps for ALL segments that contain ads/promotions.
Include a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0). Be aggressive—if it smells like an ad, flag it with high confidence.

Respond with valid JSON: {"ad_segments":[{"segment_offset":12.34,"confidence":0.9},{"segment_offset":56.78,"confidence":0.8}]}.

If there are no ads respond: {"ad_segments":[]}. Do not respond with anything else.

For example:
[142.3] ...talking about climate change...
[148.7] By the way, my new book "Earth 2.0" is out now on Amazon.
[155.2] It goes deeper into these topics. Pick up a copy today.
[161.8] Also, big thanks to FreshBox for sponsoring this episode.
[167.4] Use code EARTH for a discount.
[173.1] Back to the topic...

Output: {"ad_segments":[{"segment_offset":148.7,"confidence":0.99},{"segment_offset":155.2,"confidence":0.99},{"segment_offset":161.8,"confidence":0.99},{"segment_offset":167.4,"confidence":0.99}]}
